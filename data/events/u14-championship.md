I grew up in the streets of Mathare & got to spend a good chunk of my childhood & teenagehood at MYSA Mathare North Library. In that Library, apart from reading there's a bunch of other activities such as: Traditional dances, poetry, acting, to mention just a few. These activities are what attracted me to joining the library as an 11 years old kid. My friends and I were fascinated by the sound of
drum beats whenever we passed outside the library every evening and one day we decided to pop in and check it out.

There was a team of kids, our age, on the stage joyfully dancing to the sound of the drum beats as a bunch of onlookers cheered them. We were immediately attracted to this and we made up our minds to join the team. This decision would later shape my life for the next decade or so and give me the opportunity to meet awesome people.
